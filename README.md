# Aproplan frontend exercise

## To Do

Hello fellow developer, I've got a mission for you!

In order to fulfill the mission, you have to help me:

 - fix the bugs in the frontend and make sure the login page is correctly displayed.  After that, you'll be able to login.
	- your login credentials are: frontend@aproplan.com | aproplan
 - when you're logged in the system, call the API to get all the projects available and display them in a list.
 - when you click on a project, call the API to get all the points (API name = note) of the project and display them in a list.

**Bonus**
Impress us with a custom feature of your choice (use Angular Material, a new API call to update a point,...)!

May the force be with you!

## Aproplan

### API
To get help on the Aproplan API, check out [the API documentation](https://github.com/aproplan/aproplan-api-doc).

## Angular

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:39300/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
